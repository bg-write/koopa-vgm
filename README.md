## Key Findings
- 42% of tracks are from Nintendo franchises (Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong)
- Only 9% of tracks have Spotify releases credited before 2010, but 56% of games were released before 2010, showing classic VGM's lasting appeal through streaming platforms and the issue with modern VGM context and preservation
- 38% covers performed well but 33% originals showed slightly better engagement
- Discovery opportunities: Modern indie games (ULTRAKILL, Undertale) show strong organic growth
- Cyberpunk 2077 and ULTRAKILL emerged as unexpected modern hits
- Strong positive correlation (r = 0.663) between Spotify popularity and YouTube views
